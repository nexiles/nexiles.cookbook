Problem Statement
=================

Our company -- nexiles GmbH -- has come a long way.  We've reached a
certain state in the evolution of a company where informal communication is
no longer effective and sufficient.

We got new team members, too -- which have not experienced, for better or worse --
the tough ride we had so far at nexiles GmbH.  They're not accustomed to
the intrinsic and informal rules which we have built in our minds along the
ride.

As we continue to grow, and to diversify our products and services, it gets
more and more difficult to form a coherent view on the rules and processes
we live at nexiles GmbH.

Goals
=====

The goals of this *cook book* are:

- To form a coherent, agreed upon view of the *minimal* rules we want to
  live at nexiles GmbH

- To get a written down, agreed upon, coherent view on the *informal*
  processes we currently live at nexiles GmbH

- To have *one* set of documentation where we can point new team members
  for reference.

- To have a *evolving* and *improving* documentation.

Eventually, through evolution, we want:

- To *evolve* the informal processes into *formal processes*

- To have a *clear* message to *employees* of nexiles GmbH as of what the
  *owners* of nexiles GmbH *expect* from them, and, in turn, what
  *employees* can expect from the *owners*.  "managing expectations" is the
  key here.

Non Goals
=========

What we do **not** want to achieve is:

- We do **not** want to force new processes into place
